## MBP training format

Heavily inspired by Software Carpentry:

* 2-3 trainers + additional helpers

* Sticky notes

* Collaborative notepad

* User accounts on a training server

## Courses We Teach

Full day workshops:

* Intro to R

* RNAseq DE analysis using R

* Best Practices in R/Advanced R

Three hour sessions:

* Working with sequences and genomic features

## Examples of material sharing

* Adapting Software Carpentry material for our own course 

* Gathering online material for a Python course

* Roxanne and Stuart's RNA-seq course adapted by COMBINE

## Tools and technology

* Server set-up and management: bio-ansible

* Training interfaces: R-Studio Server and Jupyter Hub

* Training material: R Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks

* Collaborative notepads: Etherpad and Google Docs

## Training Server

* Managed by bio-ansible

* Script for adding new users and linking course datasets to their home directories

* Run R-Studio/Jupyter on a traning server means that partipants don't need to install software or download example datasets, just need a web-browser

* In theory, should be smooth to get participants going but there are always problems that crop up

## Training Material

## Collaboration Notepads

During the workshop:

* Etherpad/Google Docs: 'collaborative notepad'.

Use to share answers to challenges, write notes and ask questions.

Both free to use

Etherpad - Open source, actively developed

## Etherpad

## Etherpad

Latest version runs on `node` (server-side javascript).

Many free servers available. We've had problems when using beta.etherpad.org.

Easy to set up for yourself, for full control over settings:

```
git clone git://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite.git
cd etherpad-lite
bin/run.sh
```

(Will want to make some to changes `settings.json`, especially use a better database than the default `"dirty"`. `"sqlite"` should be fine.)
