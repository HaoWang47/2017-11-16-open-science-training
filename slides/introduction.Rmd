## MBP training format

* Heavily inspired by Software Carpentry


## Workshop set-up

* User accounts on a training server

* Google doc/Etherpad

* Sticky notes

* Workshop helpers

## Training server

* Managed by bio-ansible?

* Running R-Studio on a webserver means that partipants don't need to install software, just need a web-browser

* In theory, should be smooth to get participants going but there are always problems that crop up

## Course material

* Intro to R

* RNAseq DE analysis using R

* Best Practices in R/Advance R

## Examples of material sharing

* Adapting Software Carpentry material

* Gathering material for a Python course

* Roxanne and Stuart's RNA-seq course adapted by COMBINE
