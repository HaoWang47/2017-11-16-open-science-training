## R Markdown

[R Markdown is an authoring framework for data science.](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) An R Markdown document can execute code side by side with regular text. 

## Markdown Basics

Before we get into R Markdown, we'll touch on the basics of Markdown. The general idea behind Markdown is to write text which is as easy to read as possible that can be easily converted into HTML (or other file types). 

Markdown is both:

1. A plain text formatting syntax

2. A software tool that converts the formatted plain text to HTML

Say we want to write this:

<div class="code-exmpl">
### Today's shopping list:

* Milk
* Eggs
* Cereal
* Fruit
</div>

The text below is what you'd write in HTML:

```
<body>
  <h3>Today's shopping list:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Cereal</li>
      <li>Fruit</li>
    </ul>
</body>

```

Whereas in Markdown:

```
### Today's shopping list:

* Milk
* Eggs
* Cereal
* Fruit

```

Markdown is a lot quicker to write and is more human readable. Let's explore some more Markdown syntax together. We'll do this in a R Markdown file in R Studio since it's easy to render to html from there.

Firstly, open up a R Markdown file in R Studio.

Click the `File` tab, `New File`, then `R Markdown`.

Leave the default output as is (HTML), choose a title for the new R Markdown file or leave it blank. The new document generated will already contain text - this will demonstrate the basics of R Markdown. You can `knit` the new document to take a look at the resulting html file. Since R Studio knows that this is a R Markdown file, it will have a little `Knit` button in the source pane. This will generate a html file from the R Markdown file. 

For our purposes of working through Markdown, we're going to clear everything out of the file and save as `demo.Rmd`.

#### __Markdown syntax:__

We can format the text into a header using the `#` symbol:

```
# Time to learn some markdown!
## Time to learn some markdown!
### Time to learn some markdown!
#### Time to learn some markdown!
```

Click `Knit` or use `rmarkdown::render("demo.Rmd")` to examine the resulting html.

<div class="code-exmpl">
# Time to learn some markdown!
## Time to learn some markdown!
### Time to learn some markdown!
#### Time to learn some markdown!
</div>

The `#` symbol is Markdown's syntax for a header. The number of `#`s choose which type of header to produce. The equivalent html would be:

```
<h1> Time to learn some markdown!</h1>
<h2> Time to learn some markdown!</h2>
<h3> Time to learn some markdown!</h3>
<h4> Time to learn some markdown!</h4>
```

#### Examples of Markdown syntax - **bold** and _italics_:

`*` or `_` can be used to note _emphasis_

`**` or `__` can be used to __bold__ text

They can also be combined together:

```
*Time* to learn some markdown!

Time to _learn_ some markdown!

Time to learn **some** markdown!

Time to learn some __markdown!__

Time to learn __*some*__ markdown!

Time to **_learn_** some markdown!

Time ***to*** learn some markdown!

___Time___ to learn some markdown!
```

<div class="code-exmpl">
*Time* to learn some markdown!

Time to _learn_ some markdown!

Time to learn **some** markdown!

Time to learn some __markdown!__

Time to learn __*some*__ markdown!

Time to **_learn_** some markdown!

Time ***to*** learn some markdown!

___Time___ to learn some markdown!
</div>

#### Examples of Markdown syntax - ordered and unordered lists:

For unordered lists, you can use: `*`, `-` or `+`:

```
* a bullet point
- a bullet point
+ still a bullet point
```

<div class="code-exmpl">
* a bullet point
- a bullet point
+ still a bullet point
</div>

For ordered lists, you use a number with a dot, e.g: `1.`:

```
1. First item on our numbered list
2. Second item on our numbered list
```

<div class="code-exmpl">
1. First item on our numbered list
2. Second item on our numbered list
</div>

To create sub-lists, indent the next list evenly by two or four spaces

```
1. First item on our numbered list
    * a bullet point
    - a bullet point
    + still a bullet point
  
2. Second item on our numbered list
    * a bullet point:
        * Now with a sub-list to our sub-list
            * still with a sub-list to our sub-list
    - a bullet point
    + still a bullet point
```

<div class="code-exmpl">
1. First item on our numbered list
    * a bullet point
    - a bullet point
    + still a bullet point
  
2. Second item on our numbered list
    * a bullet point:
        * Now with a sub-list to our sub-list
            * Continuing to sub-list
    - a bullet point
    + still a bullet point
</div>

#### Examples of Markdown syntax - hyperlinks and images

To create a link, the syntax is `[]()` e.g:

```
[The link text shown on the page](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

```

This will produce:

<div class="code-exmpl">

[The link text shown on the page](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
</div>

For an image, the syntax is `![]()` e.g:

```
![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/eternal_flame.gif)
```

<div class="code-exmpl">
![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/eternal_flame.gif)
</div>

The take home here is that it's quick and easy to format your text as you write. 

## Anatomy of an R Markdown file

We are now going to work with an R Markdown file. 

An R Markdown file contains three things:

#### 1. A YAML header (optional) at the top of the document:

```
---
title: "Writing documents with R Markdown"
date: "24/10/2017"
output: html_document
---
```

This is the YAML (originally meant `Yet Another Markup Language` now stands for `YAML Ain't Markup Language`) header for this R Markdown document. The header is enclosed by two sets of three dashes `---`. This block allows you to fine-tune the output of your document. It's a set of key:value pairs that describes the file that should be built from the R Markdown file. You can adjust the theme, alter the table of contents, choose the type of file(s) to output (i.e could just be to html or to html and pdf at the same time), etc.  

At the top of our file, set the YAML header to:

```
---
title: "Your title here"
date: "Todays date"
output:
  html_document
---
```

We'll come back to this, once we've got a bit more in our document, to really appreciate the control YAML has over the output of a document.

The full list of [YAML header options for a HTML document](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html). For a [PDF document, look here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/pdf_document_format.html).

#### 2. Markdown text

We've covered this above. For now, delete the multiple headers of `Time to learn some markdown!` and create a header over the body of the text: 

```
## Markdown Basics

```

Create subheaders to the different topics (Bold and italics, lists, hyperlinks, etc). At the bottom of the document, add a new header: 

```
## Embedding Code
```


#### 3. Code chunks

Code chunks are used to render R (and code from other programming languages!) output into a document. A code chunk delimiter looks like:

` ```{r} `

` ``` `

All code falls between the triple backtrick marks, e.g:

` ```{r} `

` 1+1 `

` ``` `

You can write this manually but within R Studio, there's a little green `Insert` button in the source pane that will insert code chunks when clicked. Also when working R-Studio, a little green arrow appears at the end of the code block, clicking this will run and evaluate the code. 

Inside the curly braces, options can be passed to control the output of the code chunk, the name of the chunk, how it appears, whether it's evaluated, etc. There's also a whole range of figure options specifically for configuring the appearance of plots within the document.


```{r demo_chunk_num}

10 * 4

10:15

rep(c(1, 2, 3), times = 5)

```

If we just want to show code but not run it, we can add the `eval=FALSE` option.

```{r demo_chunk_num_not_evaluated, eval=FALSE}

10 * 4

10:15

rep(c(1, 2, 3), times = 5)

```

Or if we just want to show the results but no code, add the `echo=FALSE` option:

```{r demo_chunk_num_not_echo, echo=FALSE}

10 * 4

10:15

rep(c(1, 2, 3), times = 5)

```


We can display tables from code blocks:


```{r demo_chunk_table}

mtcars

```

The mtcars dataset is a dataset inbuilt in R that we'll use an example test dataset. The dataset here will print a non-interactive table in the output html (there are ways to change this if you want, e.g adding `df_print: paged` to the YAML header. This is useful if the table is quite large and can't fit neatly on the page). 

We can also create plots:

```{r demo_plot}
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp)
```

We can use figure options to customise the output of the plot, e.g:

* `fig.align='center` to set the alignment to the middle of the document
* `fig.height=8` to set the height of the figure
* `fig.width=8` to set the width of the figure
* `fig.cap="Fig 1. Miles per gallon vs displacement"` to add a caption describing the plot


```{r demo_plot_mod, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Fig 1. Miles per gallon vs displacement", fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp)
```

### More on YAML

#### Themes 

You've written your R Markdown file. But how do you want to present it? Maybe you don't like the default appearance of the web page. R Markdown has a number of [in-built themes](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html#appearance_and_style) you could try out to quickly change the look of a web page.

Our YAML header currently looks something like:

```
---
title: "Your title here"
date: "Todays date"
output: 
  html_document
---
```

We can add a theme like this:

```
---
title: "Your title here"
date: "Todays date"
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: journal
---
```

Other theme options: `default`, `cerulean`, `journal`, `flatly`, `readable`, `spacelab`, `united`,  `cosmo`, `lumen`, `paper`, `sandstone`, `simplex`, `yeti`.

We can also alter the appearance of code chunks with the `highlight` option:

```
---
title: "Your title here"
date: "Todays date"
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: journal
    highlight: tango
---
```

Other highlight options: `default`, `tango`, `pygments`,  `kate`, `monochrome`, `espresso`, `zenburn`, `haddock`, `textmate`.

If you want to create your own styling, you can add your own CSS to the document. We'll come back to that a little later. 

#### Table of contents

Your document has gotten very large and it's hard to navigate. You can add a table of contents to aid in navigating with `toc`:

```
---
title: "Your title here"
date: "Todays date"
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: journal
    highlight: expresso
    toc: true
---
```

This will produce a web page with a table of contents using the headers inside our document. There's a few more things we can do with the table of contents:

```
---
title: "Your title here"
date: "Todays date"
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: journal
    highlight: espresso
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 4
    toc_float: true
---
```

This will now ensure the table of contents floats on the side of the web page and is always accesible, allowing for easy navigation. By default, the table of contents depth is set to 3 so it includes any H1, H2, H3 headers. Anything lower than 3 is not included (e.g if we have a H4 or H5 header) but by setting the depth to 4, now H4 headers are included in the table of contents. Or maybe we can go the opposite way and insist that anything lower than a H2 header shouldn't be included in the table of contents (`toc_depth: 2`).

However, our floating toc defaults to collapsing down smaller headers. To prevent this behaviour, we can add `collapsed: true`:

```
---
title: "Your title here"
date: "Todays date"
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: journal
    highlight: espresso
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 4
    toc_float:
      collapsed: false
---
```

#### Document output format

Something has come up and now you need to deliver your material in a different form. We've been creating web pages from our R Markdown file so far but now you need a PDF instead.

To change the file format, we change from `html_document` to `pdf_document` under the `output` option: 

```
---
title: "Your title here"
date: "Todays date"
output: 
  pdf_document:
    theme: journal
    highlight: espresso
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 4
    toc_float: true
---
```

And when we click the `Knit` button, we use the dropdown menu, `Knit to PDF`. Our R Markdown file will now produce a PDF file instead.

Wait - an error has occured. The message we have is `unused argument (theme = "journal")`. PDF files can't take the `theme` option, this is what's causing our error. Not all YAML options are universally applicable - each document type has options that are specific to them, so it's worth looking at the [R Mardown website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html) to see what you can do with them. 

PDF files can't take the `toc_float: true` as well. Therefore we should try:

```
---
title: "Your title here"
date: "Todays date"
output: 
  pdf_document:
    highlight: espresso
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 4
---
```

We also don't need to solely produce just a web page or just a pdf file. We can do both at the same time and specify options to them:

```
---
title: "Your title here"
date: "Todays date"
output: 
  pdf_document:
    highlight: espresso
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 4
  html_document:
    toc: false
    highlight: haddock
    theme: journal
---
```

This will produce a pdf document with a table of contents and a themed web page without one. The highlights will be different for each document.

We still have to seperately knit to the type of file we want if we use the `Knit` button. Or we could use the render function: `rmarkdown::render("demo.Rmd", output_format = "all")` and this will render all the specified output types.


## Styling and Extending YAML for multiple files

### Styling

While R Markdown has a few in-built themes to customise the appearance of a document that can be passed to the YAML header, a stylesheet can be used to further customise the appearance of the document. We aren't going to cover how CSS works, but if you are familiar with it, you either write it within the body of the document or you can generate a CSS file to provide the styles you want to the document. 

e.g, if you add this in the body of your document, under the YAML block:

```
<style>
p {
  background: #e6f2ff
}
</style>

```

That applies a light blue background to all the paragraphs in the document. You could go further and add more styling but rather than sticking it in the body of the document, it's better to save the styling to a seperate CSS file.

We can write the example styling to a simple CSS file as so:

```
p {
  background: #e6f2ff
}

```

Save this as `style_demo.css` and save it in the same directory as the R Markdown you are working on. Edit your YAML header to:

```
---
title: "Demo Markdown Document"
output:
  html_document:
    theme: null
    highlight: null
    css: styles.css
---
```


This file is then passed to the YAML header - depending on how much the CSS file affects, you may need to set the theme and highlight to null to ensure no conflicts arise. 

This should change all paragraphs to have a blue background. 

It's also possible to target specific parts of the document from the CSS file by using ids and classes to section headers in the document.

For example, we want to style a specific part of our document.

```
.particular_topic_block {
    margin: 2em;
    padding: 2em;
    border: 1px solid red;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background: #ffffe6;
}

```

Then, next to one of your headers, add:

```

## Markdown Basics {.particular_topic_block}

```

This will apply the styling to this part of the document until the next header. 

It isn't pretty if you've left in the `p` styling but we hope this demonstrates how you can write your material in R Markdown and then apply styling with an external file. With just one line in the YAML header for each document, this styling can be applied to multiple files.

#### YAML for multiple documents

So you've got a bunch of R Markdown document full of material. You could set the YAML header individually for each one of them or you could create a `_output.yaml` file within the directory of multiple R Markdown files. All documents located in the same directory will inherit the YAML options defined in this file as default. However, specifically setting the YAML header of a file will overide the options from the `_output.yaml` file.

In the `_output.yaml` file, no delimiters are required:

```
html_document:
  toc: true
  toc_float: true
  toc_depth: 4
  theme: paper
  highlight: expresso
  css: style_demo.css
```

Now we don't even need to set the YAML headers for each file.

In summary with R Markdown we can:

* Write plain text that converts to HTML
* Easily embed R code into our document
* Describe how we want our document built with YAML
* Choose how to style our documents with a CSS file
* Use a YAML file to control the output of multiple R Markdown files

Things we haven't touched on but think are neat:

* [R Notebooks](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) - sort of a special execution mode for R Markdown documents. They are pretty similiar to regular R Markdown documents  but can be shared very easily. They generate a self-contained HTML file which contains a rendered copy of the notebook which can be displayed on a website as well as a copy of the notebook .Rmd itself - handy for sharing and reproducing analyses. 
* [Shiny in R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html) - You can embed Shiny code into a R Markdown file, creating interactive documents. This means you could have an [interactive slide-show presentation](http://biotraining.erc.monash.edu:3838/shiny/r-more/slides/#10) or a [html document.](https://uasnap.shinyapps.io/ex_leaflet/)
* [The Learnr package](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/index.html) - this is a new package that we haven't really played around with. It turns an R Markdown document into an interactive tutorial, which could be very useful for creating self-directed learning content. 
* [R Markdown websites](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html) are a thing - we haven't used them so we can't say more.
* [R Markdown supports other programming languages](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_knitr_engines.html) - not just R! There's support for Python, SQL, Bash, Rcpp, Stan, Javascript and CSS.
